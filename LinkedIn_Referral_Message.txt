Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I came across your post about [COMPANY_NAME]'s scaling initiatives in Product, Engineering, and AI. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to your GenAI and construction tech mission in Atlanta.

I'm currently an AI Engineer with 5+ years building production AI systems. My experience aligns well with your tech stack:
• RAG & LLMs: Lead engineer on production RAG platform using Claude 3 and multi-agent systems. Architected multi-agent orchestration using MCP (Model Context Protocol) with JSON-RPC/SSE protocols for agent-to-agent communication. Implemented optimized hybrid search (vector + metadata filtering) across 100K+ document collections
• Computer Vision: Built CNN models for image processing achieving 83% SSIM improvement, plus vision-language models
• Cloud & MLOps: Production experience with AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, Docker, Kubernetes (transferable to GCP/Vertex AI)
• Full-Stack: FastAPI, Node.js, React/Angular - ship end-to-end applications

Completing my Master's in CS at UC (GPA: 3.67/4.0) with coursework in ML, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP. AWS Solutions Architect certified.

Would you be open to referring me to one of the open positions? I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to [COMPANY_NAME]'s AI initiatives.

Thank you for your time!
